# Frontend-Practice

This repository is where I practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The goal is simple: improve my frontend skills, especially HTML and CSS.
You'll find small projects, exercises, and unfinished experiments—created purely for practice and repetition.

# About me

I'm Luuk Kessels, 25 years old.

My working journey began at 11, cleaning the parking lot at a local supermarket. At 15, I got into welding and did that until around 23—then I decided to go all-in on the digital world.

Why? More leverage. More possibilities.

At some point, my mom showed me a mood board I made when I was 12. I had written on it that I wanted to become an online businessman.
That moment hit hard. It made everything click.

Now I’m here—learning to code, because it’s the language of the future.

Thanks for reading. Nice to meet you.

Kind regards,
Luuk Kessels
